The Vector Space Model (VSM) for the given documents and vocabulary is successfully created. The VSM is represented as a matrix where each row corresponds to a document and each column represents a term from the vocabulary. The values in the matrix indicate the frequency of the vocabulary terms in each document. Here is the matrix representation:
